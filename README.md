Blog Web Application
A project done in Spring MVC, based on MySQL database. This was final project at the course that I've attended at Cubes School, and it was also my first complex web application that I've made without teacher.
You can see in the project that there is the admin part and that there is a front part divided.
If you try to access the admin part, you will get to the login form. As the passwords are crypted, you can try to enter as an admin. Login username: peter , login password: peter123   
Therefore, you can access the admin part as the administrator and you can make the changes.
If you try to login as other admin , just type the first name of the author without the capital letter, and do the same for password and add numbers 123.
The front part is accessible to everyone. 
I hope that You'll enjoy my project.
